### PC-BASIC ###
_A free, cross-platform emulator for legacy Microsoft BASIC applications._

PC-BASIC is a free, cross-platform interpreter for GW-BASIC, BASICA, PCjr Cartridge Basic and Tandy 1000 GW-BASIC.
It interprets these BASIC dialects with a high degree of accuracy, aiming for bug-for-bug compatibility. PC-BASIC emulates the most common video and audio hardware supported in their time. PC-BASIC can run (and convert between) ASCII, bytecode and 'protected' (encrypted) .BAS files. It implements floating-point arithmetic in the Microsoft Binary Format (MBF) and can therefore 
read and write binary data files created by GW-BASIC.  

PC-BASIC is free and open source software released under the GPL version 3.

### Quick Start Guide ###

This quick start guide covers installation and elementary use of PC-BASIC. For more information, please refer to the [full PC-BASIC documentation](http://robhagemans.github.io/pcbasic/doc/) which covers usage, command-line options and a full GW-BASIC language reference. This documentation is also included with the current PC-BASIC release.

If you find bugs, please report them on the SourceForge discussion page at [https://sourceforge.net/p/pcbasic/discussion/bugs/](https://sourceforge.net/p/pcbasic/discussion/bugs/). It would be most helpful if you could include a short bit of BASIC code that triggers the bug.


#### Installation ####
Packaged distributions are currently available for Windows XP and above and Mac OSX 10.6 and above. For Debian, Ubuntu, Mint and Fedora Linux an install script is provided in the source distribution.

They can be downloaded from one of the following locations:  
- GitHub at [https://github.com/robhagemans/pcbasic/releases](https://github.com/robhagemans/pcbasic/releases).  
- SourceForge at [https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcbasic/files/](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pcbasic/files/).  

On **Windows**:  
- run the installer  
- to start, click PC-BASIC in your Start menu  

On **OS X**:  
- mount the disk image  
- move `PC-BASIC.app` to your Applications folder  
- to start, double click the PC-BASIC app  

On **Linux**:  
- untar the archive  
- run `sudo ./install.sh`  
- to start, click PC-BASIC in your Applications menu or run `pcbasic` on the command line.  


#### Installation from source ####
If your system is not supported or you prefer to install from source, download the source distribution and unpack the TGZ archive. 
The following packages are needed or recommended when installing PC-BASIC from source:

| Package                                                         | OS                 | Status       | Notes  
|-----------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------|----------------------------  
| [Python 2.7.6](http://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.6/)  | all                | required     |   
| [PyWin32](https://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/)            | Windows            | required     |  
| [PyXDG](http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pyxdg/)            | Linux, other       | required     |  
| [PyGame 1.9.1](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml)            | all                | essential    | for sound and graphics  
| [NumPy](https://sourceforge.net/projects/numpy/files/)          | all                | essential    | for sound and graphics  
| [PySerial](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial)               | all                | recommended  | for serial port access  
| [PyParallel](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyserial)             | Windows, Linux     | optional     | for parallel port access  
| [Pexpect](http://pexpect.readthedocs.org/en/latest/install.html)| OSX, Linux, other  | optional     | for native `SHELL`  

In this list, _other_ refers to operating systems other than Windows, Linux or OSX.  

On **Windows**, you should download all the required packages from the project web sites linked above.  

On **OSX**, there are several versions of Python 2.7 and all downloads need to match your version and CPU architecture. It's a bit tricky, I'm afraid. The easiest option seems to be installing both Python and PyGame through MacPorts or Homebrew.  

On **Linux distrubutions with APT or DNF** (including Debian, Ubuntu, Mint and Fedora), the install script will automatically install dependencies if it is run with root privileges.  

The install script can also be used on **other Unix** systems or when not installing as root. Python 2.7 usually comes pre-installed; the other packages can often be installed through your package manager. For example, on Debian-based systems:   
`sudo apt-get install python2.7 python-xdg python-pygame python-numpy python-serial python-pexpect python-parallel xsel`  
On Fedora:  
`sudo dnf install python pyxdg pygame numpy pyserial python-pexpect xsel`  
On FreeBSD:  
`sudo pkg install python27 py27-xdg py27-game py27-numpy py27-serial py27-pexpect xsel`
Note that PyParallel is not available from the Fedora and FreeBSD repos; you'll need to install from source or do without access to physical parallel ports. It is _not_ needed for printing to `LPT1`.  

The official Pygame release 1.9.1 has a bug in its handling of copy & paste on X11-based systems.
If you run into this, install one of the [`xsel`](http://www.vergenet.net/~conrad/software/xsel/) or [`xclip`](https://sourceforge.net/projects/xclip/)  utilities and PC-BASIC will work around the issue.  


#### Usage essentials ####
Double-click on `pcbasic` or run `pcbasic` on the command line to start in interactive mode with no programs.  
A few selected command-line options:  
`pcbasic PROGRAM.BAS` runs PROGRAM.BAS directly.  
`pcbasic -h` shows all available command line options.  

If you're running PC-BASIC from a GUI, you can set the required options in the configuration file instead. The configuration file is a file named `PCBASIC.INI`, stored in the following location:

| OS         | Configuration file location  
|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------  
| Windows XP | `C:\Documents and Settings\` (your username) `\Application Data\pcbasic`  
| Windows 7  | `C:\Users\` (your username) `\AppData\Roaming\pcbasic`  
| OS X       | `~/Library/Application Support/pcbasic`   
| Linux      | `~/.config/pcbasic`  

For example, you could include the following line in `PCBASIC.INI` to emulate IBM PCjr Cartridge Basic instead of GW-BASIC 3.23:

    preset=pcjr  


For a full list of options, run `pcbasic -h`.


#### Basic BASIC commands ####
PC-BASIC starts in interactive mode, where you can execute BASIC statements directly. 
A few essential statements:  
`SYSTEM` exits PC-BASIC.  
`LOAD "PROGRAM"` loads `PROGRAM.BAS` but does not start it.  
`RUN` starts the currently loaded program.  
`RUN "PROGRAM"` loads and starts `PROGRAM.BAS`.  

A full CC-licensed GW-BASIC language reference is included with PC-BASIC. This documentation aims to document the actual behaviour of GW-BASIC 3.23, on which PC-BASIC is modelled. Please note that the original Microsoft help file, which can be found on the internet, is rather hit-and-miss; GW-BASIC often behaves differently than documented by Microsoft. 


#### Free BASIC compilers and saner dialects ####
If you're starting a new project in BASIC, please consider one of the more sensible free versions of the language, such as [FreeBasic](www.freebasic.net), [QB64](http://www.qb64.net/) or [SmallBASIC](https://sourceforge.net/projects/smallbasic/). Under FreeDOS, you can use the [Bywater BASIC](https://sourceforge.net/projects/bwbasic/) interpreter. 


#### GW-BASIC links and downloads ####
[Norman De Forest's description of the tokenised file format](http://www.chebucto.ns.ca/~af380/GW-BASIC-tokens.html) is where this project started.  
[Dan Vanderkam's online GW-BASIC decoder](http://www.danvk.org/wp/gw-basic-program-decoder/) was another inspiration.
